# B0nec0me - Stealer for Skids
Bonecome is a basic and experimental fucking stealer, open source for script kiddies, and created in C++, with a clear warning: I hate black hats. They just want to see everyone burn. With this stealer, you can read, write, and experiment with your C2 or VMS or shit, so deal with it.
